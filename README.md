# Industrial-Automation-using-LabView
Lab View is a industry grade tool used for automating/controlling things easily. It just uses a blockdiagram based coding which enables users to understand and use it quickly. In this project we implemented a system which detects the colour that is being sent by the user and sends the according signal to the arduino based on that colour through serial communication. LabView also have many features which makes it a industry loved tool.
